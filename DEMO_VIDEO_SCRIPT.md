## 🎬 Intro: The Hook (0:00 - 0:45)

**Visual:** Camera on you (or high-energy logo animation).

**Script:**
"Hi! Hiring technical talent is broken. You spend hours writing JDs, days screening thousands of spam resumes, and weeks scheduling basic technical rounds.

Today, I'm going to show you the **Agentic AI Hiring Suite**. It’s an end-to-end autonomous recruiter that writes your JDs, creates custom tests from scratch, screens resumes 24/7 with human-like reasoning, and even proctors the tests for you.

We are going to do a live walkthrough of hiring a **Python Backend Developer** from scratch. Let's dive in."
