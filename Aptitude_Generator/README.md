## 🚀 Interconnected Job-to-Test Workflow

RecruitAI features a unique bidirectional integration where the output of the JD Generator serves as the primary intelligence for the Aptitude Generator.

### 🔗 The "Strategic Feed" Workflow

1.  **JD Phase**: The Recruiter provides a job title (e.g., "Fullstack Developer") and key tech stack. The **JD AI Agent** generates a comprehensive job description.
2.  **The Interconnection**: This generated JD is fed directly into the **Aptitude Analysis** engine. Instead of a generic test, the system maps questions specifically to the nuances of the generated JD.
3.  **Aptitude Phase**: The **MCQ Generator** hand-picks 10-25 technical questions. The recruiter selects the best ones and triggers the email outreach.
4.  **Closing the Loop**: Candidates take the test, and their results are automatically recorded in the unified dashboard for the HR team.

## 🚀 Quick Start (LinkedIn Post Draft)

**Headline**: I just built an Agentic Hiring Suite that turns a Job Title into a Live Technical Test in < 60 seconds! 🚀

**Body**:
Ever spent hours writing a JD and then looking for relevant interview questions? I decided to automate the whole thing.

My new project **RecruitAI** uses #Llama3.3 to:

1. Generate a professional JD 📝
2. Map that JD to technical MCQs 🧠
3. Send those MCQs to candidates via email 📧
4. Track scores in a live dashboard 📈

It’s built using **FastAPI** and **Groq** for extra speed. No more "resume fatigue"—just data-driven hiring.
