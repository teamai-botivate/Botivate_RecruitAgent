            INSTRUCTIONS:
            1. Evaluate relevance to the JD (Skills, Experience, Role Fit).
            2. EXTRACT DETAILS (CRITICAL):
               - "years_of_experience": Calculate ONLY from professional work history dates.
                 * DO NOT count University/College duration (e.g. 2021-2025) as work experience.
                 * Count Internships if labeled clearly.
                 * Example: A 2025 graduate has ~0-1 years exp, NOT 4 years.
               - "extracted_skills": List of technical skills actually found.
               - "email" and "phone": Extract EXACT text found. Do NOT redact. Do NOT use placeholders like "[EMAIL]". If not found, return "Not Found".
            3. LOOK FOR HIDDEN GEMS: Check for Hackathons, Open Source (GitHub), Awards, Publications, or Complex Side Projects.
            4. *CRITICAL*: Assign an 'achievement_bonus' (0-20 points) based on these hidden gems.
               - 0: None
               - 5-10: Good projects/certs
               - 15-20: Hackathon winner, major open source contribution.
            5. Classify status as "High Potential" or "Review Required".
            6. YOU MUST RETURN A JSON OBJECT FOR ALL 1 CANDIDATES provided. Do not skip any.
            7. For "hobbies_and_achievements", list SPECIFIC project names (e.g. "MyNovelList Backend") or stats (e.g. "500+ LeetCode"). Do not be generic.
